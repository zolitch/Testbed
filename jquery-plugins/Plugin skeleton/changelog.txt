CHANGE LOG
==========

27 September 2011 - 14:40:01 - DT    cross domain files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-   added cross domain file for flash
-   added facebook/oauth channel.html
-   added facebook xd_receiver


23 September 2011 - 14:34:13 - DT    Added Media common media queries folders
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   Now got folders within css folder which are designed for css relating to common
    media queries. The core.css files are included within the htmlhead partial
    with media attributes so that only the appropriate files are downloaded



12 July 2011 - 13:54:23 - SZ	New Front End Templating setup
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-	The Appia project will now export different versions of the site to dev.
	
-	The dev url ie: frontent.projectName.aquepreview.com will now point to a generic Aqueduct index.html file in the root.
	This file will contain links to the current working dev version (dev/) and previous sprint versions (sprint-1/ ,sprint-2/ etc)
	The data for this is pulled from the updated model/global.js file.
	
-	model/global.js now contains a pages object and version array. 
	We still need to find a way to dynamically update the pages obect here based on the pages existing in pages/ folder.
	It is a manual process for now.
	
- 	There is other functionality that needs to be added to the build scripts too. 
	The index file for the root on the server needs to be extracted and renamed from 'root-index.html' to'index.html'
	and placed in the root of the dev frontend server. The site then needs to replace what exists in the dev/folder.
	On version change, a new version folder needs to be created and the existing dev/ version moved to it.
	


SITE NOTES
==========
This site uses Appia which is a static templating system developed by Aqueduct which can be
found at http://github.com/aqueduct/appia

Please refer to the _exports folder if there is one, otherwise run the appia.exe to
start the internal server.

Anything in the pages folder should be accessed from the route.
